# The Jira Chronicles ⏳

A tale of two timelines. An interactive click-through story exploring what project management could look like if we reimagined it with AI.

> **Disclaimer:** This is a creative thought exercise and conversation piece, not a real product or product proposal. It's meant to spark discussion about how AI might change the way teams work together.

## The Story

Two timelines. One where we're stuck in ticket theater — standups that could've been emails, estimation poker nobody believes in, invisible work that never gets credit. And one where AI actually sees the work happening.

Built with React + Vite. AI helped bring the brainstorm to life — that's the point.
